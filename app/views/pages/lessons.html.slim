    h2 Students use Quill to learn English grammar by writing sentences and proofreading passages.
    p We've built 42 lessons directly from the Common Core State Standards. We are a nonprofit organization, and all of our lessons will always be made freely available.
    p Each of our lessons takes approximately 10-15 minutes. Teachers using Quill in a 1:1 classroom tend to assign Quill lessons as a warm up exercise at the beginning of a class.
