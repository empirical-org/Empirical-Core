# Welcome to the Quill universe.

Each package and service in our repository has its own idiosycracies that will
be documented in it's own README.

## Structure

If you've installed the repository hooks, it's time to start writing code that
will help a student become a better writer. Here is a quick overview of where to
find what you're looking for.
 
- **services**. This directory contains 4 self-contained applications of the core Quill offering.
  - [comprehension/README.md](services/comprehension/README.md)
  - [QuillCMS/README.md](services/QuillCMS/README.md)
  - [comprehension/README.md](services/QuillLessonsServer/README.md)
  - [comprehension/README.md](services/QuillLMS/README.md)
- **packages**. Packages can be backend Quill apps that serve the front-end, or
  utilities that are used or have been used in Quill. Some of these packages are
  generalized so they can be easily used in 3rd party applications.

## Getting started

Make sure you've installed the repository hooks and understand the Quill
universe structure.  Checking out open issues is a great way to get started as
an open source contributor.
