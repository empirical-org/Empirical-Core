### Glossary

###### Submission
Every time a student inputs a sentence for feedback.
###### Answer
An answer is a graded submission with feedback. These are contained in the answer bank. The initial set of answers and feedback is created by humans and the algorithm can then automatically add feedback to a new, unique submission to create a new answer.

###### Feedback
A string of text that tells the student whether the submission was a strong submission or not and provides a hint if it is not a strong submission.

###### Feedback Type
The feedback type is a series of five labels to indicate.
- Human optimal
- Human sub-optimal
- Algorithm optimal
- Algorithm sub-optimal
- Ungraded

###### Algorithm Type
The algorithm type indicates which algorithm was used to match the submission to a pre-existing answer.

- Case Matching
- Punctuation Matching
- Fuzzy Matching

Under Development:
- Word Count Matching
- Word Bank Matching
- LanguageTools Matching
- Parts of Speech Matching
- Insert - Delete Matching
