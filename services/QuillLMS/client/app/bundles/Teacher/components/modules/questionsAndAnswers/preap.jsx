    question: 'What is Quill.org?',
    answer: <p>Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.</p>

    answer: (
      <div>
        <p className="college-board-q-and-a-text">As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 1, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.</p>
        <p className="college-board-q-and-a-text">You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.</p>
        <p className="college-board-q-and-a-text">In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that are part of each unit’s instructional materials. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.</p>
        <p className="college-board-q-and-a-text">In addition to the previously mentioned tools and resources, you will also see direct links to Quill.org activities throughout English 1 lessons where specific grammar skills are addressed. The links will take students to independent practice activities that align with the writing goals of that particular lesson.</p>

    question: 'Is a writing skills survey different than a diagnostic?',
    answer: <p>Quill&apos;s writing skills surveys can be used in lieu of Quill&apos;s general diagnostics. For example, an AP teacher would likely assign the AP Writing Skills Survey in lieu of the Advanced Diagnostic. Keep in mind, however, that teachers may want ELL students in Pre-AP, AP, or SpringBoard courses to begin with one of the ELL Diagnostics instead of a writing skills survey. <a href="https://support.quill.org/en/articles/2554430-what-are-the-differences-between-the-various-diagnostic-assessments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This article explains the differences between Quill’s various diagnostics and surveys in more depth</a>.</p>

    question: 'How many activities are in each Pre-AP Writing Practice pack?',
    answer: <p>Each Pre-AP recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, each of which are designed to take between 10 and 15 minutes each. There are also additional practice packs for students who finish the Pre-AP recommended packs: same skills, new content. <a href="https://support.quill.org/en/articles/4579893-how-do-i-assign-additional-practice-packs-for-pre-ap-skills-surveys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Learn how to find and assign those here.</a></p>

    question: 'How many Pre-AP Writing Practice packs should I assign to my students and how long will it take them to complete a pack?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>You can assign all the recommended packs in one click, or you can pick and choose, revisiting the recommendations report to assign more packs as needed.</p>
        <p>In general, we&apos;ve found that students make progress when they are completing 2-4 activities on Quill per week. Since each Pre-AP recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, teachers generally expect a recommended pack to be completed in 1-2 weeks. Of course, students may need more or less time depending on the amount of activities in the pack, their level of difficulty, and students&apos; level of proficiency. </p>
