              After your students complete a SpringBoard 6-8, Pre-AP, AP, or ELL writing skills survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

              Students receive immediate feedback that guides them through the revision process, pushing them to think critically about their writing and make revisions that ultimately lead to strong, sophisticated, and grammatically accurate sentences. The feedback inspires students to strengthen their sentence structure, but also supports them in editing for mechanics such as punctuation and spelling.

Use the analysis report to review your students' work sentence-by-sentence, or use the summary report to get a high-level sense of where your students could use some extra support.

              Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.

                      Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.

                      As part of the customized offering for SpringBoard, there are a variety of writing skills surveys to be used, depending on the context of your classes and students. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by course texts and frameworks.

                      You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                      In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that appear in the instructional materials of both the Pre-AP English I course Grade 9 SpringBoard English Language Arts: English I. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.

                      Teachers generally begin by having students complete a writing skills survey during class time. The practice that is recommended once students complete a survey can be completed by students independently and at their own pace, or can also be completed during class time. Some teachers ask students to complete recommended activities during a “Do Now,” during another portion of class time, or as homework. Since SpringBoard’s Language and Writer’s Craft elements of activities feature focused practice on specific grammatical skills, you may also find that there are

                      It is recommended that you and your students create free accounts on Quill.org. Creating an account will give you access to the two skills surveys and recommended practice; creating an account also allows you to track your students’ progress and view data reports. You can create an account by visiting the Quill

                    Quill's writing skills surveys can be used in lieu of Quill's general diagnostics. For example, a 7th grade SpringBoard ELA teacher would likely assign the SpringBoard Writing Skills Survey in lieu of the Starter or Intermediate Diagnostic. Keep in mind, however, that teachers may want ELL students in Pre-AP, AP, or SpringBoard classes to begin with one of the ELL Diagnostics instead of a writing skills survey.

                      In general, we've found that students make progress when they are completing 2-4 activities on Quill per week. Since each recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, teachers generally expect a recommended pack to be completed in 1-2 weeks. Of course, students may need more or less time depending on the amount of activities in the pack, their level of difficulty, and students' level of proficiency.

                          Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini-lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson.

              After your students complete a SpringBoard 6-8, Pre-AP, AP, or ELL writing skills survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

              Students receive immediate feedback that guides them through the revision process, pushing them to think critically about their writing and make revisions that ultimately lead to strong, sophisticated, and grammatically accurate sentences. The feedback inspires students to strengthen their sentence structure, but also supports them in editing for mechanics such as punctuation and spelling.

              You can monitor the progress of your students and continue to identify areas of need and areas of strength through multiple data reports. Use the analysis report to review your students' work sentence-by-sentence, or use the summary report to get a high-level sense of where your students could use some extra support.

              Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.

                      Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.

                      As part of the customized offering for SpringBoard, there are a variety of writing skills surveys to be used, depending on the context of your classes and students. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by course texts and frameworks.

                      You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                      In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that appear in the instructional materials of both the Pre-AP English I course Grade 9 SpringBoard English Language Arts: English I. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.

                      Teachers generally begin by having students complete a writing skills survey during class time. The practice that is recommended once students complete a survey can be completed by students independently and at their own pace, or can also be completed during class time. Some teachers ask students to complete recommended activities during a “Do Now,” during another portion of class time, or as homework. Since SpringBoard’s Language and Writer’s Craft elements of activities feature focused practice on specific grammatical skills, you may also find that there are

                    Quill's writing skills surveys can be used in lieu of Quill's general diagnostics. For example, a 7th grade SpringBoard ELA teacher would likely assign the SpringBoard Writing Skills Survey in lieu of the Starter or Intermediate Diagnostic. Keep in mind, however, that teachers may want ELL students in Pre-AP, AP, or SpringBoard classes to begin with one of the ELL Diagnostics instead of a writing skills survey.

                      In general, we've found that students make progress when they are completing 2-4 activities on Quill per week. Since each recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, teachers generally expect a recommended pack to be completed in 1-2 weeks. Of course, students may need more or less time depending on the amount of activities in the pack, their level of difficulty, and students' level of proficiency.

                          Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini-lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson.

                          Students complete an activity designed to help teachers determine which skills students need to work on. After students complete a Quill Diagnostic activity, Quill recommends writing activities for students based on their results.
