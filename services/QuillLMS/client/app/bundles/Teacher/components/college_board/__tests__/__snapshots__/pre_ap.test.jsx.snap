                        After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

                        Some of your students may benefit from more opportunities to practice a skill after they have completed the activities recommended based on their writing skills survey results. In that case, you can assign a second set of independent practice activities: same skills, new content.

                        Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

                        In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

              After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

              Some of your students may benefit from more opportunities to practice a skill after they have completed the activities recommended based on their writing skills survey results. In that case, you can assign a second set of independent practice activities: same skills, new content.

                Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

              In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

              At least one activity appears in each Learning Cycle of all four instructional units so that this sentence-combining practice can easily be incorporated into your instructional plans. Since these activities include details about the texts and analysis of key elements,  they are best used to reinforce learning after students have read and discussed these texts in class.

              Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.

            <p>
              Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.

                    Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.

                      As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 1, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.
                    </p>

                    >
                      You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                      In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that are part of each unit’s instructional materials. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.

The links will take students to independent practice activities that align with the writing goals of that particular lesson.

                      As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 2, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.

                      You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                      It is recommended that you and your students create free accounts on Quill.org. Creating an account will give you access to the two skills surveys and recommended practice; creating an account also allows you to track your students’ progress and view data reports. You can create an account by visiting the Quill

                    Quill's writing skills surveys can be used in lieu of Quill's general diagnostics. For example, an AP teacher would likely assign the AP Writing Skills Survey in lieu of the Advanced Diagnostic. Keep in mind, however, that teachers may want ELL students in Pre-AP, AP, or SpringBoard courses to begin with one of the ELL Diagnostics instead of a writing skills survey.

                    Each Pre-AP recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, each of which are designed to take between 10 and 15 minutes each. There are also additional practice packs for students who finish the Pre-AP recommended packs: same skills, new content.

                      In general, we've found that students make progress when they are completing 2-4 activities on Quill per week. Since each Pre-AP recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, teachers generally expect a recommended pack to be completed in 1-2 weeks. Of course, students may need more or less time depending on the amount of activities in the pack, their level of difficulty, and students' level of proficiency.

                          Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini-lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson.

                        After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

                        Some of your students may benefit from more opportunities to practice a skill after they have completed the activities recommended based on their writing skills survey results. In that case, you can assign a second set of independent practice activities: same skills, new content.

                        Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

                        In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

Since these activities include details about the texts and analysis of key elements,  they are best used to reinforce learning after students have read and discussed these texts in class.

              After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

              Some of your students may benefit from more opportunities to practice a skill after they have completed the activities recommended based on their writing skills survey results. In that case, you can assign a second set of independent practice activities: same skills, new content.

                Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

              In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

              At least one activity appears in each Learning Cycle of all four instructional units so that this sentence-combining practice can easily be incorporated into your instructional plans. Since these activities include details about the texts and analysis of key elements,  they are best used to reinforce learning after students have read and discussed these texts in class.

              Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.

            <p>
              Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.

                    Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.

                      As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 1, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.
                    </p>

                    >
                      You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                      In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that are part of each unit’s instructional materials. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.

                      As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 2, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.

                    >
                      You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                      It is recommended that you and your students create free accounts on Quill.org. Creating an account will give you access to the two skills surveys and recommended practice; creating an account also allows you to track your students’ progress and view data reports. You can create an account by visiting the Quill

                    Quill's writing skills surveys can be used in lieu of Quill's general diagnostics. For example, an AP teacher would likely assign the AP Writing Skills Survey in lieu of the Advanced Diagnostic. Keep in mind, however, that teachers may want ELL students in Pre-AP, AP, or SpringBoard courses to begin with one of the ELL Diagnostics instead of a writing skills survey.

                    Each Pre-AP recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, each of which are designed to take between 10 and 15 minutes each. There are also additional practice packs for students who finish the Pre-AP recommended packs: same skills, new content.

                      In general, we've found that students make progress when they are completing 2-4 activities on Quill per week. Since each Pre-AP recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, teachers generally expect a recommended pack to be completed in 1-2 weeks. Of course, students may need more or less time depending on the amount of activities in the pack, their level of difficulty, and students' level of proficiency.

                          Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini-lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson.

                        After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

                        Some of your students may benefit from more opportunities to practice a skill after they have completed the activities recommended based on their writing skills survey results. In that case, you can assign a second set of independent practice activities: same skills, new content.

                        Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

                        In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

              After your students complete a Pre-AP Writing Skills Survey, Quill will use the results to recommend a set of independent practice activities. You can choose to assign all the practice at once, or you can pick and choose the activities that best fit your instructional and students’ needs. As students complete the practice, they’ll receive instant feedback on their writing that guides them through the revising and editing process.

                Each sentence-combining activity is aligned to a different text from the four English 1 instructional units. As students combine sentences and build their writing skills, they also explore key text elements: historical and authorial context, plot, structure, and more. These activities model the kind of analytical thinking they would optimally reflect in their own writing.

              In these sentence-combining items, students are free to use any grammatically correct method of combining the sentences they choose. However, each item is written to provide opportunities for students to practice the skills from the course framework. No matter which method students choose to use, they will receive instant, targeted feedback on up to five revisions to help them strengthen their sentence and build their writing skills.

              At least one activity appears in each Learning Cycle of all four instructional units so that this sentence-combining practice can easily be incorporated into your instructional plans. Since these activities include details about the texts and analysis of key elements,  they are best used to reinforce learning after students have read and discussed these texts in class.

              Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.

              Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.

                    Quill is a writing tool that provides over 600 writing, grammar, and proofreading activities designed to engage students in the writing process. Quill provides practice in many areas of sentence writing, from comma placement and subject-verb agreement to the use of conjunctions to convey complex relationships between ideas. In the Quill Connect tool, students practice writing different types of sentences using the evidence-based strategy of sentence combining. Students receive specific, targeted feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their work. Through these activities, students practice writing a variety of sophisticated sentences and practice conveying complex ideas in clear, succinct, and grammatically strong ways. Most activities are designed to be completed in 10-15 minutes so that you have the freedom to use them in the way that works best for your classroom.

                      As part of the customized Pre-AP + Quill Offering for English 1, there are two distinct skills surveys. Pre-AP Skills Survey 1 addresses the basics of sentence patterns, while Pre-AP Skills Survey 2 engages with tools for sentence expansion. The skills featured as part of each survey are derived directly from the elements of grammar called out by the Pre-AP English High School Course Framework.

                    >
                      You can use these skills surveys during the course to assess your students’ needs and to generate a sequence of recommended activities that provides targeted writing practice on the skills addressed instructionally in the Learning Cycles. In each of these recommended practice activities, students receive immediate feedback on their writing that they can use to revise their responses up to five times. Through these rounds of feedback and revision, students practice key writing skills.

                      In addition to the skills surveys and recommended practice activities, there are also sentence combining activities aligned to texts that are part of each unit’s instructional materials. These activities provide additional opportunities for students to practice their writing in context, combining sentences with a variety of skills and approaches that explore key ideas and themes from these texts.

                      In addition to the previously mentioned tools and resources, you will also see direct links to Quill.org activities throughout English 1 lessons where specific grammar skills are addressed. The links will take students to independent practice activities that align with the writing goals of that particular lesson.

                      It is recommended that you and your students create free accounts on Quill.org. Creating an account will give you access to the two skills surveys and recommended practice; creating an account also allows you to track your students’ progress and view data reports. You can create an account by visiting the Quill

                    Quill's writing skills surveys can be used in lieu of Quill's general diagnostics. For example, an AP teacher would likely assign the AP Writing Skills Survey in lieu of the Advanced Diagnostic. Keep in mind, however, that teachers may want ELL students in Pre-AP, AP, or SpringBoard courses to begin with one of the ELL Diagnostics instead of a writing skills survey.

                    Each Pre-AP recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, each of which are designed to take between 10 and 15 minutes each. There are also additional practice packs for students who finish the Pre-AP recommended packs: same skills, new content.

                      You can assign all the recommended packs in one click, or you can pick and choose, revisiting the recommendations report to assign more packs as needed.

                      In general, we've found that students make progress when they are completing 2-4 activities on Quill per week. Since each Pre-AP recommended pack contains between 4 and 7 activities, teachers generally expect a recommended pack to be completed in 1-2 weeks. Of course, students may need more or less time depending on the amount of activities in the pack, their level of difficulty, and students' level of proficiency.

                          Teachers lead whole-class writing instruction. Teachers control interactive slides that contain a mini-lesson and guided practice. Teachers can model writing strategies in real-time, present prompts to which students can respond, and then anonymously display student responses for discussion. Each Quill Lessons activity provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and a follow-up independent practice activity. Teachers can also customize any lesson.
