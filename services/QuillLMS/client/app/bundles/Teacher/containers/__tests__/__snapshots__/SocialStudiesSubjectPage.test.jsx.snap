          Quill Social Studies activities allow teachers to give students the literacy instruction they need while covering core course content. In these Reading for Evidence activities, students read course-aligned texts, use what they’ve read to draft evidence-based claims, and receive AI-powered feedback to strengthen their writing. Process and growth are key: our responsive coaching guides students to revise until their sentences are clear, logical, and grounded in specific details from the text.
          <br />
          <br />
          Quill Social Studies is designed to supplement high school social studies courses. World History: 1200 CE-Present is available now, and World History: 1750 CE-Present will launch during the 2024-2025 school year!

          Written and reviewed by social studies educators, each Quill Social Studies text highlights a moment or movement linked to course themes. Not only do these activities deepen students’ subject area learning and reinforce essential social studies content, they also provide support for:

          OER Project
        </a>
         to curate open educational resources from their site that work well with Quill social studies content. On the course landing page, each Reading for Evidence activity includes a suggested paired OER Project leveled text (ranging from 600L to 1500L). These texts can be used to preview new content, reinforce prior knowledge, provide additional historical context, or, when used in conjunction with the Quill activity, serve as part of a text set to support extended writing practice. Whether used on their own or as part of the full OER Project curriculum, these resources are a valuable addition to any high school world history classroom.
