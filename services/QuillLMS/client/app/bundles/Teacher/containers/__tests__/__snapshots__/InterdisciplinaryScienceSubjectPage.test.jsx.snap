        <p>
          Over the next few years, Quill will building out Reading for Evidence activities aligned to high school science classrooms. Our first offering, Building AI Knowledge, features activities that introduce students to how AI will impact society over the next decade. In the future, we will build offerings around biology, earth sciences, and other science topics.
          <br />
          <br />
          In these Reading for Evidence activities, students read science-aligned texts, use what they’ve read to draft evidence-based claims, and receive AI-powered feedback to strengthen their writing. Process and growth are key: our responsive coaching guides students to revise until their sentences are clear, logical, and grounded in specific details from the text.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our Interdisciplinary Science work is meant to be used in either ELA or science classrooms. These activities are not meant to replace a textbook. Our activities provide a deep-dive into some of the most fascinating ideas in science.

          Written and reviewed by educators, each Quill Interdisciplinary Science activity highlights a science concept. Not only do these activities deepen students’ subject area learning and reinforce essential science content, they also provide support for:

         to curate activities from their site that work well with Quill Building AI Knowledge activities. On the course landing page, each Reading for Evidence activity includes a suggested paired aiEDU activity, which range from 5-minute warm-up activities to 3-4 hour student-led activities. These activities can be used to preview new content, reinforce prior knowledge, provide additional context, or, when used in conjunction with the Quill activity, serve as part of a text set to support extended writing practice. Whether used on their own or in conjunction with aiEDU activities, these resources are a valuable addition to any high school ELA or Computer Science classroom.
