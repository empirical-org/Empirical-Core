    return <p>Provide your students with nonfiction texts paired with AI-powered writing prompts, instead of multiple-choice questions, to enable deeper thinking. Students read a nonfiction text and build their comprehension through writing prompts, supporting a series of claims with evidence sourced from the text. Quill challenges students to write responses that are precise, logical, and based on textual evidence, with Quill coaching the student through custom, targeted feedback on each revision so that students strengthen their reading comprehension and hone their writing skills.<br /><br /> Designed for 8th-12th grade students, each activity takes 15-20 minutes to complete. Quill is developing activities for ELA, social studies, and science classrooms, with a particular focus on texts that examine 21st-century issues.</p>

        <p>In this response, it&apos;s true that seaweed benefits cows by reducing their methane emissions, but the student has not specified *why* seaweed is beneficial. Quill asks the student to go back to the text and examine it more carefully to provide a reason why seaweed benefits cows and the environment. Students must use precise evidence in their response to be able to successfully complete it.</p>

Since the key ideas are in place, Quill now provides a mini-lesson on the grammar errors in their response. Quill only provides grammar and spelling feedback once the student has written a strong response with the key ideas from the text.</p>

Students often come into the tool writing vague or inaccurate statements, and through multiple rounds of practice, feedback, and revision, students gain the ability to utilize precise evidence in their responses.</p>
