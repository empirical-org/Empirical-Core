Texts are 500-700 words long and are written at an eighth or ninth grade reading level. After reading, students highlight sentences about a key idea, and then complete a sentence stem about a key idea to write three sentences using evidence from the text. Throughout the writing process, they receive multiple rounds of feedback and opportunities to revise.

                  <p>
                    Reading for Evidence activities are built upon a writing activity in which students complete a sentence stem about content they are learning using the conjunctions, or joining words, because, but and so. Students use…
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <i>
                        because
                      </i>
                       to provide a reason or cause
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i>
                        but
                      </i>
                       to provide a contrast or counterpoint
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <i>
                        so
                      </i>
                       to provide a result or effect
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Thus, in one Reading for Evidence activity, so much happens simultaneously.

                    In one activity, so much happens simultaneously. Content knowledge and reading comprehension are assessed, as well as deepened. Students are challenged to think in a multi-dimensional way about the idea in the sentence stem, as well as think through important logical relationships. With the conjunctions 
                    <i>
                      because
                    </i>
                     and 
                    <i>
                      so
                    </i>
                    , students think about 
                    <strong>
                      cause-and-effect
                    </strong>
                    , and with 
                    <i>
                      but
                    </i>
                    , they think about a 
                    <strong>
                      claim and counterclaim
                    </strong>
                     (a central aspect of argumentative writing). When they complete these stems with precise evidence, students are 
                    <i>
                      anticipating
                    </i>
                     the information their readers need—in other words, they're making the move of an effective writer! These conjunctions also lay the foundation for more complex, abstract language. 
                    <i>
                      Because
                    </i>
                     and 
                    <i>
                      so
                    </i>
                     pave the way for cause-and-effect language like 
                    <i>
                      since
                    </i>
                     and 
                    <i>
                      as a result
                    </i>
                    , while 
                    <i>
                      but
                    </i>
                     lays the foundation for change-of-direction language like 
                    <i>
                      even though
                    </i>
                     and 
                    <i>
                      on the other hand
                    </i>
                    .
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through Reading for Evidence, we've been able to amplify the value of this strategy for students and teachers alike. How? First, our Curriculum team collects hundreds of authentic responses to stems about an engaging, nonfiction text. Next, they categorize the misunderstandings and errors in those responses and write hundreds of pieces of custom feedback for those categories. This allows them to train artificial intelligence (AI) to match each student's unique response to the right feedback. That feedback coaches the student to refine their logical reasoning, clarify their ideas, and provide specific, precise evidence, as well as to correct any grammatical and mechanical errors. The student has the opportunity to revise each sentence up to four times. Thus, the student participates in an interactive and rigorous reading, writing, and thinking experience, all in just ten to fifteen minutes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The skills students practice in the paper-based version of this activity are among the most fundamental to effective writing. In effect, Reading for Evidence provides each student with their own private coach—a coach who addresses their particular strengths and areas of growth, and who guides them through deliberate, carefully designed practice. Thanks to the remarkable power of artificial intelligence (along with some very hard-working engineers and curriculum developers), this is an experience available to every one of your students.

                  In most online reading tools, students read a passage and then answer multiple-choice questions. In these activities, students have often learned that they can read the questions first, scan the text for the “right answer,” and once they've found it, move on. Alternatively, in a Reading for Evidence activity, students must have read and 
                  <i>
                    understood
                  </i>
                   what they read in order to complete the sentence stems effectively. They have to 
                  <i>
                    think
                  </i>
                   and 
                  <i>
                    write
                  </i>
                  , not just select A, B, C, or D. What's more, when students struggle, the tool coaches them—showing them where to reread, suggesting information to include in their response, etc. Then, immediately, they get the chance to implement that feedback and to 
                  <i>
                    revise
                  </i>
                  , multiple times.

                    In a Reading for Evidence activity, students read a nonfiction text relevant to multiple content areas, particularly ELA, social studies, and science. Texts are 500-700 words long and are written at an eighth or ninth grade reading level and explore compelling, complex questions like: “Should schools have grade requirements for student athletes?” and “Should medical testing be done on animals?” There are currently 18 activities available, organized into the following thematic packs:

                    First, it's very important students know this is a NEW tool (that's why each activity has the word “beta” at the end of its name). This means the feedback will sometimes be off or unhelpful. Each activity's feedback gets more accurate and precise as more students complete it, allowing us to retrain its algorithms based on those authentic student responses. However, this is a new tool, and the AI will make mistakes! 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If students do receive feedback they find unhelpful or confusing, please encourage them to let us know. They can click the “Report a Problem” button under any piece of feedback they receive in a Reading for Evidence activity. They can also share general feedback through the brief emoji survey at the end of every activity. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It might also be helpful to explain to students that the activities are not graded—and why. We want students to focus on understanding the text and revising their sentences based on feedback, not on the grade or score they will get. In other words, we want these activities to be a sandbox for students to develop as readers, writers, and thinkers, and not feel like a high-stakes, summative assessment.

                    In addition to understanding that this tool is in beta, it will be helpful for students to know more about the kind of writing the tool will encourage and discourage. Reading for Evidence focuses on the specificity and accuracy of evidence in students' responses. This means students may give an accurate response, but still be pushed for further specificity. Similarly, if students write a response that is valid but not based on evidence from the text, they will be encouraged to revise using evidence from the text. Likewise, students will be discouraged from incorporating direct quotations. If a response uses more than ten words in sequence that are directly from the text, Reading for Evidence will ask them to put the ideas into their own words. While quoting is not supported in the tool, you can, of course, have students work on the use of direct quotes outside of Reading for  Evidence. You may also be interested in

                  <p>
                    Reading for Evidence will also discourage students from drawing conclusions or making claims. If a student starts their “so” response with “we should,” “I will,” or with a command like “start”—they will get feedback that they've given an opinion and redirected to use evidence from the text instead. This helps to narrow the variety of responses students may submit, thus making it more likely that the tool gives accurate feedback.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may be thinking: What is wrong with a student giving an opinion or a command? In fact, you might very much

                    </i>
                     your students to draw their own conclusions from the text about what actions and next steps should be taken to address the issue described. Indeed, those are perfectly good things for students to do in their persuasive or argumentative writing. However, think of the sentences students are writing in this tool as an important scaffold to that kind of writing. Before students can draw their own conclusions, we first need to know that they understood what they read and that they can rewrite it in their own words.

                       This helps students develop the "soft skill" of applying feedback. This is also a great place to explain what Reading for Evidence is looking for. For example, you might model writing an accurate but general response, and then applying the feedback to revisit the text for more specific evidence.

                       We know from research that when students write about content, they have better understanding and retention of that content. Furthermore, what they learn about writing is more meaningful and more likely to stick. Whenever possible, help students connect the content in Reading for Evidence activities to content they've studied in your class. This can be as simple as assigning an activity at a time when its topic is relevant to your curriculum. For example, an English teacher might assign

                    This first iteration of the Reading for Evidence tool is most appropriate for general education students in grades 8-12. However, the tool can provide valuable practice for students who don't fall into this category. Here are some ways you can support students who may need additional scaffolds:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>
                        Introduce the main idea of the text and front-load vocabulary.
                      </strong>
                       For example, images/illustrations, videos, magazine/newspaper articles, realia, etc. can be used to help students access an activity text and activate relevant schema. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>
                        Use browser extensions to provide read aloud and language support.
                      </strong>
                       Over the next several months and years, we will embed more scaffolds within the tool. For example, students will be able to hover over challenging vocabulary to see a student-friendly definition, etc. However, in the meantime, Reading for Evidence integrates with a variety of extensions that can provide important support. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>
                        Model how to find evidence and how to incorporate feedback.
                      </strong>
                       There is so much metacognition at work when completing these activities. Pulling back the curtain on that for students can be powerful—and empowering!
