Any money that a married woman earned or inherited automatically belonged to her husband. Laws also prevented married women from purchasing or owning property. Women’s job options were limited too. Wealthier women were mostly expected to manage their households and support their husband’s work, while poorer women often held labor-intensive and low-paying jobs, like working as servants or manufacturing textiles and other goods.<br/>Many women were also deprived of educational opportunities. While some wealthier women and girls were educated at home and could read, poorer girls often had no access to education and were required to begin working as young as seven years old.</p>"

By defying her father and making her own choice about marriage, Juliet asserts her agency and independence.<br/>Juliet’s decision not to marry Paris and stay true to her secret husband Romeo is what sets the ending of the play into motion.
