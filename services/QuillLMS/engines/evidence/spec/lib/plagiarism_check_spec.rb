        let(:plagiarism1) { "It seemed like no one wanted to go to Matthew J. Kuss Middle School. In 2005, 200 families were trying to withdraw their kids from the school in Fall River, Massachusetts. The school’s academic performance and attendance rates were consistently among the lowest in the state. Today, Kuss is one of the highest performing public schools in its district, and there’s even a waiting list of students who want to attend. What changed? Kuss extended its school day by two hours—giving students an extra 300 hours of learning time each year. Extending learning and enrichment Education experts who support extended school days think that additional instructional time could lead to increased student performance. For example, eight elementary schools in Washington D.C. extended their hours in 2012. By the end of that school year, seven of those schools had made huge gains in standardized testing scores, with math scores growing by 10.6 percent and reading scores growing by 7.2 percent. Longer days also give students more time to participate in special electives. Students at Kuss learn computer science and robotics, collaborating on projects like automatic pencil dispensers and prototypes for smart homes. Another school in the same district uses its extended hours to teach classes on model rockets, the science of soda, and photography. Students can even raise trout and learn survival skills in a wilderness studies class. Paying the price for extended hours Unlike after-school programs or clubs, these extra hours are required for all students, even those with busy after-school schedules. Critics worry that this mandatory extra time at school is overwhelming for some students. After school days that stretch almost until sunset, students have just a few hours to do their homework, participate in extracurricular activities, and relax. One student who used to spend his afternoons on the basketball court found himself effectively benched by longer school days. “I stopped [playing sports] last year as soon as the whole extended school day started,” he told the Hechinger Report. Keeping schools open longer also isn’t cheap. Some schools might need to secure grants or ask for more money from taxpayers to purchase additional materials and pay their staff for the extra time. One school district that tested longer school days reported an average additional cost of $300,000 per school. A growing movement Despite some resistance, education organizations like the National Center on Time & Learning continue to push for extended school days. Advocacy by education experts has resulted in growing numbers of American students staying in class longer. As of 2016, around 1,500 schools in the United States had implemented extended learning schedules. That number could grow even larger as some states explore lengthening school days to make up for learning losses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the bell rings Back at Kuss Middle School, students fill their lengthened school days with 90-minute English, math, and science periods and a rotating menu of electives. While the days are long, many students appreciate how the extended schedule gives more time for unique electives and in-depth class discussions. As one Kuss student told the National Center on Time and Learning, “I think more people are coming to our school because they know that there is at least one thing that will make their middle school years memorable.”" }
        let(:plagiarism2) { "they are filled with tourists because many Native Hawaiians can no longer afford to live in these homes. Tourism is part of the reason food can be so expensive, but it doesn’t stop there. Tourism also makes housing more expensive. Rent in Honolulu, Hawaii, is over 200% higher than the national average. Curious about the less-touristy parts of the islands, more and more non-Native Hawaiian buyers and companies are buying homes in areas like Kailua to use as second homes or rent out to tourists. The more homes that non-Hawaiians buy, the less that are available for Hawaiians—and the more expensive the remaining homes become. While the lack of affordable housing affects all Hawaii residents, Native Hawaiians are disproportionately affected. This is due in part to US colonization. Many Native Hawaiians had their land taken away after the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown. Today, only about 20% of Hawaii’s population identifies as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander—but this group makes up over half of the islands’ homeless population. Hawaii has the highest cost of living in the nation, meaning that food, housing, clothing, electricity, and other things all cost more in Hawaii than anywhere else in the United States. Moving from the islands to the Las Vegas desert has provided some Native Hawaiians with a better standard of living. However, many feel that there is no substitute for the rich culture they were forced to leave behind." }
