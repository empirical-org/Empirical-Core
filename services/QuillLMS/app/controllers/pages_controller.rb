            question: "How does Quill work?",
            answer: "
            <p>Quill provides 10-15 minute exercises that help students build sentence construction skills. Quill automatically grades the writing and provides feedback and hints to help students improve it. The immediate feedback enables students to quickly build their skills, and it saves teachers dozens of hours spent on grading.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Quill also offers whole-class or small-group collaborative lessons led by the teacher, lasting about 20-30 minutes. Teachers control interactive slides that contain writing prompts, and students respond to each prompt. Each Quill Lesson provides a lesson plan, writing prompts, discussion topics, and follow-up independent practice activities.</p>

            question: "How do Quill's tools work?",
            answer: "<p>Quill currently offers 5 tools. The 5 tools are designed to work together seamlessly—activities from any tool can be assigned from the same place, in the same way, and you can mix and match activities from the different tools to build your own activity packs.</p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Quill Proofreader</strong></p>
            <p>In Quill Proofreader, students proofread a passage to find and correct the errors. Some passages focus on a specific grammar concept, but many cover a wide range of skills to mirror a real-life proofreading and editing process.</p>
             <br />
             <p>Once students have made all their edits to the passage, we'll highlight for the student which edits are correct, which are unnecessary, and which are incorrect or not found. Then, students are automatically assigned a follow-up activity from Quill Grammar that addresses one of the skills the student needs to practice based on their proofreading.</p>
             <br />
             <p><strong>Quill Grammar</strong></p>
             <p>In Quill Grammar, students practice the basics of sentence mechanics. Here is where you'll find activities to practice skills like using proper capitalization, recognizing the difference between pronouns, and much more. As students practice these skills, they are given five chances to revise each response. After each revision, students receive feedback to help them improve their sentence.</p>
             <br />
             <p><strong>Quill Connect</strong></p>
             <p>Quill Connect is our sentence combining tool, and our most popular. In Quill Connect, students develop their sentence construction skills by combining multiple short sentences into a more sophisticated single sentence. Students are given up to five opportunities to revise their work, receiving immediate targeted feedback after each revision that guides them toward a stronger response.</p>
          <br />
          <p><strong>Quill Diagnostic</strong></p>
          <p>Quill offers four diagnostics that can be used to evaluate your students' writing. The goal of the diagnostics is to provide you with enough information about your students' needs that you can assign the most appropriate activities for your students. Because diagnostic activities are evaluative, students will not receive any feedback on their responses and will only have one attempt per question. </p>
              <br />
              <p>Once students complete a diagnostic, you'll get a report that details the results and that includes a series of recommended activities for each individual student based on their diagnostic performance. Although the detailed report shows a numerical score to help you group students into tiers, it is graded for completion elsewhere on your and your students' dashboards.</p>
              <br />
              <p><strong>Quill Lessons</strong></p>
              <p>Quill Lessons is our first tool designed to provide direct, whole-class instruction rather than independent practice. Each Quill Lesson activity includes a lesson plan with step by step instructions and explanations, and a slide-style presentation that can be projected to the class. Each student connects to the lesson using their own devices and can participate in real-time, answering questions and writing responses that can be displayed to the whole class for teacher-led discussion.</p>"
          },
          {
            question: "How does Quill provide personalized instruction and opportunities for differentiation?",
            answer: "<p>Quill offers six diagnostics and four writing skills surveys, each covering different sentence construction skills. Once your students complete a diagnostic or survey, we'll create a set of recommended activities tailored for each student based on their diagnostic results. As the teacher, you can review these recommendations and assign them all or pick and choose the ones you'd like students to complete based on your own evaluation of their needs.</p>
              <br />
              <p>You can also personalize instruction for your students by building your own activity packs. Search our entire library of content and build custom packs that can be assigned to your whole class, small groups, or individual students, giving you the freedom to assign activities that are specific to your students.</p>"
          },
          {
            question: "What approach does Quill take to giving students feedback on their writing?",
            answer: "<p>After each revision, students receive feedback on their writing. In consultation with teachers and based on current research on how to provide grammar instruction for students, we have made a few very intentional style decisions that we follow as we write this feedback. Here's an overview of some of the guidelines that our student-facing feedback follows:</p>
                <br />
              <ul>
                <li>We try to avoid using technical grammar terms and jargon; whenever possible, we try to talk about grammar concepts in terms of their function rather than their technical name.</li>
                <li>We try to use language that encourages revision as a natural part of the writing process rather than focusing on whether the student's writing is right or wrong.</li>
                <li>We try to find the right balance between guiding students with clear directives and explanation and encouraging students to think critically about their writing and discover the necessary revisions themselves.</li>
              </ul>"
          },
          {
            question: "How are Quill's activities linked to Common Core Standards?",
            answer: "
              <p>Each activity is assigned a Common Core State Standard that aligns with the grammar target of the activity. Because we recognize that the Common Core State Standards do not always map to the needs of students, we recommend deciding what's right for your students based on the grammar concept of the activity rather than the grade level indicated by the activity's CCSS. For example, we have found that many of our 4th grade CCSS activities, such as those that explore relative pronouns and clauses, are actually more appropriate for middle or high school students.</p>"
            },
          {
            question: "How are Quill activities named?",
            answer: "<p>We have a lot of activities in our library! Most of these activities are named based on the specific grammar concept they cover.</p>
              <br />
              <p>You'll notice that some activities also include words like \"Starter\" or \"Intermediate\" in the name. These words indicate the general level of the activity. Because intermediate activities build on the skills practiced in starter activities, we typically recommend having students complete a starter activity for a given skill before moving on to that skill's intermediate activities.</p>
             <br />
             <p>Some activities also include a number. If an activity includes a number, that means there are other activities that cover the same grammar concept at the same level. For example, if your students complete Parallel Structure 1 but you feel they need additional practice at that level, you can assign Parallel Structure 2.</p>"
            },
          {
            question: "What does it mean if an activity is labeled as \"Advanced Combining\"?",
            answer: "<p>Many of our activities cover a specific grammar concept, but some of our activities are categorized as \"Advanced Combining\" instead. These activities are ones that allow students to combine sentences using any grammatically correct method. Students will receive feedback based on the structure they chose to use. Advanced combining activities are a great way to give your students opportunities to problem solve and be creative in their sentence construction. Because they provide little direction for students, we recommend having students complete a few activities with a clear grammar target before doing advanced combining activities, especially if they are new to sentence combining.</p>"
            },
          {
            question: "What happens if a student answers a question incorrectly?",
            answer: "<p>Our goal is to build strong writers who have made revising an essential part of their writing process. For that reason, we provide students with the opportunity to revise each response up to five times until they have written a strong, grammatically correct sentence. After each revision, students receive feedback that guides them towards a stronger response. If after five revisions the response is still not considered strong, we'll show a few sample responses and ask the student to choose the strongest one before moving on to the next question.</p>"
            },
          {
            question: "Can students retry an activity?",
            answer: "<p>Students can retry an activity as many times as they want. Once a student has completed an activity, it remains on their dashboard, available to retry at any time.</p>"
          },
          {
            question: "How do the colored scores work?",
            answer: "<p>Quill utilizes a stoplight system of green, yellow, and red scores. A green square indicates that the student scored 76-100%. A yellow square indicates the student scored 50-75%. A red square indicates that the student scored under 50%. A grey square indicates an uncompleted lesson.</p>"
          },
          {
            question: "How does Quill decide which grammar rules to teach?",
            answer: "<p>Quill follows the guidelines for grammar and style published in the Chicago Manual of Style. While other style guides are geared towards specific audiences and genres of writing, the Chicago Manual of Style is designed to support writers of all types.</p>"
          },
          {
            question: "How does Quill address learning for English Language Learners?",
            answer: "<p>Quill provides three diagnostics specifically for ELL students. Directions for each diagnostic are available in Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Korean, Urdu, Tagalog (Filipino), Vietnamese, Russian, Thai, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Dari (Eastern Farsi), Arabic, and Hindi.</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>The ELL Starter Diagnostic covers the basics of sentence writing in English, including how to use \"to be,\" \"to have,\" and \"to want\" in simple sentences and questions. It is most appropriate for students who are still building their English vocabulary and beginning to work on sentence structure and verb conjugation.</li>
            <br />
            <li>The ELL Intermediate Diagnostic is recommended for students who already have a foundation in English. It includes topics such as subject-verb agreement, prepositions, and question words.</li>
            <br />
            <li>The ELL Advanced Diagnostic covers skills that tend to be particularly challenging for English Language Learners, including regular and irregular past tense, phrasal verbs, and commonly confused words.</li>

            answer: "<p>Teachers create teacher accounts and students create student accounts by clicking <a href='https://www.quill.org/account/new'>here</a>. Teachers are given a class code for each class. Students join their teacher's class by plugging in their teacher's class code. Teachers may also manually create accounts for their students. If you have a Google Classroom account, you can sign up with Google and import your students.

We work with a large team of volunteers who spend their time on this project because they believe in this mission. We, in turn, have no interest in ever being purchased by another company or being sold on the stock market. While we are a commercial nonprofit, and intend to generate sustainable revenue, our mission is to revolutionize how students learn.</p>"
