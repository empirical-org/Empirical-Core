          <p class="activity-sub-text">Students complete a seventeen-item survey to gauge their understanding of key writing skills that are essential to successful AP- and SAT-level writing. After students complete the survey, Quill will automatically recommend up to seven activity packs for each student based on their needs. Each pack contains a series of activities that each take about 15 minutes to complete and provide scaffolded, sequenced practice with one of the skills covered by the survey.</p>

          <p class="info-blurb-text">After students complete the AP Writing Skills Survey, you'll receive recommendations for each student based on their responses and tailored to their individual needs. Each student will be recommended up to 45 sentence combining activities, grouped by concept into seven packs, that provide meaningful, targeted practice. You can assign all the activities with one click, or you can pick and choose.</p>

          <p class="info-blurb-text">Students receive immediate feedback that guides them through the revision process, pushing them to think critically about their writing and make revisions that ultimately lead to strong, sophisticated, and grammatically accurate sentences. The feedback inspires students to strengthen their sentence structure, but also supports them in editing for mechanics such as punctuation and spelling.</p>

          <p>Teaching writing is hard. Even harder can be attempting to pinpoint exactly when we learned how and why to write clearly. That’s why the College Board has worked with Quill.org to ensure that this new, free, comprehensive offering helps students practice targeted sentence construction skills in their writing. Sustained practice and exposure to targeted skills is important to improvement and comfort.</p>
          <p>Teaching writing may always be hard, but student practice in meaningful skills can make the learning that much clearer. Through this practice, students can begin to own the how and why of their writing.</p>
